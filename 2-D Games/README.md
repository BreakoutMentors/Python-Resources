[Snake](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/55bff16f67)
- Challenge 1: Can you get the movement in all 4 directions working? (Hint: look at both `keyPressed()` and `moveEverything()` functions)
- Challenge 2: Can you add a random target to collect? (Hint: it would be great to have a function that can do this)
- Challenge 3: Can you call the `snakeHitTarget()` function to determine when you collected the target? Your score should increase, the snake speed should increase, and the target should go to a new random location.
- Challenge 4: Can you add a score label?
- Challenge 5: What should happen when you hit the edge? Maybe add a ['Click to Start' screen](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/c493716bfb).
- Challenge 6: What would make it more fun?
