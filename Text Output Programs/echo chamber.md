# Echo Chamber

Create a program that repeats whatever the user tells them back to the user twice. A sample interaction might be (human typing in bold):


> You find yourself at the mouth of a large cave.<br>
> What do you say to it? **Is anyone there?**<br>
> The cave echoes back to you: Is anyone there? Is anyone there?


Bonus extension: can you give the user an option to set how many times the cave echoes back? ie:

> You find yourself at the mouth of a large cave.<br>
> How echo-y is this cave (enter an integer)? **5**<br>
> What do you say to it? **Is anyone there?**<br>
> The cave echoes back to you: Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Is anyone there?


Bonus-bonus extension: can you give the user the option to keep saying things to the cave, until they choose to walk away (perhaps by entering a keyword, "WALK AWAY"?)
