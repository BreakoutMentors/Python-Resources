# Processing Graphics Intro

## Setup
To use the graphics library, see [this project](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2a112790dc) with the basic structure.

You need to `import` the code, then create the `setup()` and `draw()` functions that will be used when you call `run()`.

Depending upon your computer screen size, `size(600, 400)` might be a good area for your drawings.

## Creating shapes
Try the following commands in `draw()`. What do each of the input numbers do?

```python
line(30, 250, 250, 30)
ellipse(200, 200, 20, 20)
rect(300, 100, 40, 40)
triangle(20, 20, 20, 40, 40, 40)
```
