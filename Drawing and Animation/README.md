# Drawing and Animation


[Processing Graphics Library](processing%20intro.md)
- Challenge 1: Create a new Python file in Trinket to try out the example commands
- Challenge 2: Make your own drawing. A happy face, robot, or house are good projects. Example: [Squidward Drawing](https://trinket.io/python/58b4d9d057)
- Challenge 3: Create your own function that you can use to easily draw something more complex. Start with this [Mickey Mouse Ears](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/0872428a92) project (this [Happy Face Example](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/a24fc5e9fc) may help if you want to scale the image size)

[Mouse and Keyboard](mouse%20and%20keyboard.md)
- Challenge 1: Create a new Python file in Trinket to try out the example commands
- Challenge 2: Can you create a small text label on the screen (not printed to the console) that shows the mouse location?
- Challenge 3: Can you create a new shape whenever the mouse is clicked?
- Challenge 4: Can you make your earlier drawing interactive depending upon where your mouse is? Ideas are changing the location of the eyes or background color.
- Bonus challenge: Can you create a paint application? Example: [Paint](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/f083bab647)

[Random Art](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/3a0ad9e3a6)
- Challenge 1: Can you make the screen 600 x 600?
- Challenge 2: Can you make each starburst have 8 lines?
- Challenge 3: Can you add circles at random locations with a random color?
- Challenge 4: Can you make those circles have a random diameter between 10 and 30?
- Challenge 5: Can you add random rectangles too?
- Bonus challenge: What would make it look cooler?

[Animation](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2081273daf)
- Challenge 1: Can you make the ball appear lower on the screen?
- Challenge 2: Can you make the ball go twice as fast?
- Challenge 3: Can you switch the ball's direction?
- Challenge 4: Can you make the ball switch directions when it hits an edge? (So it just keeps bouncing back and forth. Hint: might need a new variable.)
- Challenge 5: Can you make the ball double in speed with each bounce? (You might need to give it a max speed too.)
- Challenge 6: Can you add an image that travels in both the x and y directions, bouncing off all four walls?
<br><br>

[Animation with Lists](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/cfa17d968e)
- Challenge 1: Can you change it to a left to right movement for the balls?
- Challenge 2: Can you add a character that goes to where the mouse is to make it look more like a shooting motion?
- Bonus challenge: What would make it look cooler?
<br><br>

[Ball Splitting Animation](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/13aab8492f)
- Challenge 1: Read the code to see how it works
- Challenge 2: Can you make it split into 3 instead of 2?
- Bonus challenge: What would make it look cooler?
