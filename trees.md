# Trees

The tree data structure is very useful for hierarchies of information. Think a family tree. 

The information stored is a node. This might be a person's name. They are connected to other nodes by edges. Down the tree is a called child relationship, up the tree is a parent relationship. The top most node is called the root.

A tree data structure is usually implemented on your own, as opposed to a feature of the coding language like a list/array or dictionary/map. It sets up really well for using recursion - for example searching the node and a recursive call to search all its children.
