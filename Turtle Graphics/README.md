# Turtle Graphics

There is another way to use graphics in Trinket: with the turtle. It is similar to the Pen tool in Scratch, it can trace wherever you tell the turtle to go. [Check out this example with all the basic commands you need.](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/e9439f4079) 

## Challenge 1: Make a Triangle and Square

Let's draw some shapes. See if you can create an equilateral triangle and a square using the forward and left or right commands. 

## Challenge 2: Use Loops and Functions

Did you use a loop to create those shapes? If not, that is fine, but update your code now. 

That will make this next step easier. Create a turtle_square function that takes one input for the side length. Now you can easily draw squares of different sizes all over the screen.

## Challenge 3: Generalize to a Polygon

What is the difference between the triangle code and the square code? How can we generalize to make a pentagon or any other polygon? Hint: what is the sum of all the turns?

See if you can make a turtle_polygon function that has two inputs: size and number of sides.

## Bonus challenge: Stars

Stars are not too different than polygons. 

## Bonus challenge: Spirals

What happens if you turn a fixed angle, but change the side length? What can you make?

## Bonus challenge: Overlapping Squares

Here is a fun challenge from [Vivax Solutions](https://www.vivaxsolutions.com/web/python-turtle.aspx):

[Here is an example to get you started with filled in shapes.](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/d53a2b5046) Be sure to use functions to keep your code short and readable. It will also allow you to easily switch to using a different shape if you want.
