#Python Dictionaries

Data structure is the term used for how code stores information beyond simple variables. A list is an example you have seen before.

Now let's look at a Python dictionary, which is great for storing unordered information in key-value pairs.

Fun fact: other programming languages use different terms for the same data structure. For example the Python list is called an array in Java and JavaScript. The general term for a Python dictionary is "associative arrays" because it associates info into key-value pairs. In Java and JavaScript they are called Maps because they map information from key to value.
